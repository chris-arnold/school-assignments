ASSIGNMENT 1
DUE SEPTEMBER 20, 2013

test.sh will do a clean compile and run various test cases of myps

Most of the logic has been added to testreaddir.c, with function calls to getFlagInfo.c when required.

Execution and compilation has been tested on my Ubuntu 12.04.3 machine as well as a PC in CL 115.
